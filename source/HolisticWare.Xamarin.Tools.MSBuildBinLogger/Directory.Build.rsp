# This file contains command-line options that MSBuild will process as part of
# every build, unless the "/noautoresponse" switch is specified.
#
# MSBuild processes the options in this file first, before processing the
# options on the command line. As a result, options on the command line can
# override the options in this file. However, depending on the options being
# set, the overriding can also result in conflicts.
#
# NOTE: The "/noautoresponse" switch cannot be specified in this file, nor in
# any response file that is referenced by this file.

# /binaryLogger[:[LogFile=]output.binlog[;ProjectImports={None,Embed,ZipFile}]]
#                     Serializes all build events to a compressed binary file.
#                     By default the file is in the current directory and named
#                     "msbuild.binlog". The binary log is a detailed description
#                     of the build process that can later be used to reconstruct
#                     text logs and used by other analysis tools. A binary log
#                     is usually 10-20x smaller than the most detailed text
#                     diagnostic-level log, but it contains more information.
#                     (Short form: /bl)
#
#                     The binary logger by default collects the source text of
#                     project files, including all imported projects and target
#                     files encountered during the build. The optional
#                     ProjectImports switch controls this behavior:
#
#                      ProjectImports=None     - Don't collect the project
#                                                imports.
#                      ProjectImports=Embed    - Embed project imports in the
#                                                log file.
#                      ProjectImports=ZipFile  - Save project files to
#                                                output.projectimports.zip
#                                                where output is the same name
#                                                as the binary log file name.
#
#                     The default setting for ProjectImports is Embed.
#                     Note: the logger does not collect non-MSBuild source files
#                     such as .cs, .cpp etc.
#
#                     A .binlog file can be "played back" by passing it to
#                     msbuild.exe as an argument instead of a project/solution.
#                     Other loggers will receive the information contained
#                     in the log file as if the original build was happening.

#                       /bl:output.binlog;ProjectImports=None
#                       /bl:output.binlog;ProjectImports=ZipFile
